# tag-std

This project aims to provide an annotation-based approach to managing safety-related comments in unsafe Rust code. It has three main objectives:
- The annotation system should be user-friendly and compatible with existing developer workflows.
- The annotations should be syntactically checkable by the compiler, thereby enabling standardized usage.
- If sufficiently precise, the annotations could also support formal verification, for example by being extended into contracts. However, this is not required for general projects.

See this [pre-RFC](pre-RFC.md) for more details.

The project is named **tag-std** because it was originally intended to standardize safety property annotations for unsafe code within the Rust core and standard libraries through a simple yet precise tag-based approach. We have already defined a set of [primitive safety properties](primitive-sp.md) to describe the safety concerns associated with unsafe APIs in the standard library, and we have [labeled these unsafe APIs with tags](data/std.json) accordingly. In addition, we have developed a systematic method to detect annotation discrepancies through program analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of safety tags. For more details, please refer to our paper:

While we are formulating the [annotation method](usage.md) and developing the [corresponding tools](safety-tool), we are also exploring the application of this approach to Rust projects beyond the standard library, including [Rust-for-Linux](https://github.com/rust-for-linux) and [Asterinas](https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas)
